This was an Software Engineering Practice Class project. It uses Spotify's free Web API for Developers to create a web application.
The website is called Moodify, it's goal is to allow users to create playlists by swiping with a tinder style interface on recommended tracks.
The user can adjust genre settings, which pull from an SQL database that contains 300,000 spotify song seeds that we pulled off kaggle.
The majority of the songs are not modern or up to date tracks, we had to use this workaround for our project as Spotify depreaciated many of
api calls that actually gives you random songs in their database.

The database doesn't come with the code and needs to be setup yourself as we never actually hosted this website on the internet, it was ran on localhost
from our computers for presentation purposes with a local MySQL database.

If you find this hopefully it can give you some tips on how Spotify's API calls are actually made and help you with your own project.
